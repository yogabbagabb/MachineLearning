This repository contains programs that I wrote to get basic exposure to some machine learning algorithms. These programs are all based off of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course, although unlike the heavily scaffolded course (which fills in over 70% of
the details of any algorithm), I've done everything by scratch, at times relying on optimization modules in scipy to test my algorithms.
